# Lean Wine

This is a fairly lean build of [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) specifically for
old Windows console applications.

The motivation to create this was to have the ability to run a Halo PC
dedicated server on Linux without needing a large Wine installation.

A default Wine setup on most distributions takes up at least 1,5 GB of space,
this build uses less than 800 MB.

OK, admittedly, not a superb optimisation but hey it's not bad! Plus, a
semi-fun learning experience.

If you have further optimisations, feel more than welcome to create an issue!
