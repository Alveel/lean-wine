# Lean Wine

## Motivation

This is a lean build of [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) specifically for
(old) Windows console applications.

The motivation to create this was to have the ability to run a Halo PC
dedicated server on Linux without needing a large Wine installation.

A default Wine setup on most distributions generally takes up more than 1,5 GB
of space, this build comes out at about 660 MB.

Admittedly, not a superb optimisation but hey it's not bad! Plus, a
semi-fun learning experience.

If you have further optimisations, feel more than welcome to create an issue!
